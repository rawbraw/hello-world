# hello-world

Michael Parado

I came to github to be apart of a community dedicated to making solutions and programs to optimized 
how we live each and everyday. I may be new but if I'm able to learn and work with dedicated others
maybe we just create that spark that lights a new innovation into traction. You only have to find the way once
and show others the way to where you go. A code and step method is the perfect way for us to transcend the ever growing
chain of information and translating it all.
